By 2020, 80 percent of the population of Europe's 500 million people will be living in urban environments. Four times more people will be living in dense cities, towns and suburbs than 70 years ago [1](1). In spite of recent promotion of urban and vertical farming techniques, only very few could pride themselves with being food secure in case of #collapse. 

This sobering realization begs for the question *how can we create sustainable and environmentally regenerative food production and consumption systems* which are able to withstand these pressure with grace?

dsrp's recipe for re-building the necessary infrastructure requires consideration of three central pillars: *Distribution*, *Production* and *Consumption* outlined below. 

## Distribution

### Why SMART Cities are _not_ smart enough

_218w_  

Aquaponics, vertical farming and even large-scale indoor farms have been proposed as solutions to increase the resilience of food systems for the SMART cities of the future. These _pioneering projects in urban farming are well-suited for densely populated countries_, such as the Netherlands (where predominantly rural areas make up only 2.1% of its land). (reference). 

Nevertheless, even if these technologies were to be replicated and used at scale, they would likely be insufficient to be able to cover all the dietary needs of Europe's urban population. Some staple crops, such as grains, require extensive land surfaces to grow. Most importantly though, *we should ask ourselves the question whether growing food in scarce urban land, in highly artificial, energy-intensive environments the most efficient way to obtain nourshiment?* 

Consider this: The only upper limit to agricultural production is the sun. Choosing to lose 80% efficiency by first converting it to electricity before using it to grow food, should only be a matter of absolute necessity and not a fundamental principle of SMART food production. 
<*questionable/ might need rephrasing: it is not the availability of sun energy which might be the reason to want controlled aquaponics environments - it's likely going to be its lack of balance between sun and watering- manifested through droughts etc*>

### Reviving regional food networks 

_256w_  

_dsrp's proposition for increasing resilience in food systems is the strengthening of Europe's regional food networks_ - based on peri-urban supply chains, cooperatives and Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). 

This is not a new vision, of course. Farmer Cooperatives have been around ever since the 19th century in both commercial and more community-based forms, and the network of CSA is Europe has expanded to over 13 EU countries since the 1990s. Although with some fluctuation, the movement is growing, with farmer markets witnessing a in recent years (Reference??). 

Considering the fact that 42% of Europe's population is concentrated in 10% of the land [1], strengthening the infrastructure of _farmer and consumer cooperatives_ and _Community Supported Agriculture_ is crucial for authentic food security in Europe in case of #collapse. These two solutions can give access for consumers to high quality organic food through pre-financing agreements with nearby farmer cooperatives, or through weekly food baskets subscriptions (Reference). The payoff of investments in regional food production infrastructure assures that peri-urban, rural farmers and the most vulnerable social groups can farmers stay in business and integrated in the local economy (Reference -i.e. ASAT, AFF in Romania). Last but not least, it gives direct control to both farmers and consumers over how food is produced. 

_New open-source information technology software for cooperatives_ can now ease the administrative burden of coops, coordinating sourcing and distribution from multiple farms to hundreds of consumers (Reference). The idea is to _re-create shorter alternative supply chains, outside of the conventional supermarket system - ones increasingly based on trust, without the need for intermediaries and costly certification schemes. _.

These new upgraded cooperative models can help create a positive loop towards more resilience for people, economies and most importantly for our soils and biodiversity. 

And the good news is ... there are many interesting initiatives already starting all over Europe! We'll be happy to share some replicable examples through our dsrp blog. 

## Production 

### Regenerative Agriculture - the self-enforcing loop of resilience

_208w_  

Intensive agriculture and conventional farming models have resulted in 30%–85% of EU agricultural land being affected by soil degradation. Productivity gains for major crops have consequently starting to decline around the world. The annual cost of soil degradation in Europe amounts to €38 billion [2](xx). 

Regional and community-owned food production and distribution systems offer an opportunity for scaling up _regenerative forms of agriculture, which aim to obtain surpluses for humans, only_ after  _having satisfied the ecological needs of building healthy soil and increasing biodiversity_ [2](x). Regenerative agriculture practices include permaculture, agro-forestry, organic, no till, holistic grazing or a combination thereof. These make use of nature's own symbiotic mechanisms to produce both food and maintain healthy ecosystems [3].  

_Nurturing soil and increasing biodiversity are key elements in creating a positive self-enforcing feedback loop in agricultural ecosystems_. The healthier the soil and the greater the variety of species which can interact and synergize in agricultural systems, the more yields can be obtained in coming years with less external input (Reference). Healthy soils are a very important building block on the way back to a resilient and economically prosperous food system - one able to withstand shocks in the face of potential #collapse scenarios. 

###Food Forests and Permaculture: Strength in diversity
_340w_  

_Combining several regenerative practices, species and therefore also income streams in regenerative agriculture production unlocks tremendous economic value for farmers_. 
>The Ellena MacArthur Foundation estimates that **a  200% higher profitability could be achieved by shifting to regenerative vegetable multi-culture**, combining multiple types of annual and perenial crops, and holistic ecosystem management techniques in a way that mimics nature [3].

_Creating food forests through permaculture techniques provides a good example on how this could be done_.  The natural cessation of prennial and annual plants allows farmers to grow vegetables, salads and beans while fruit and nut trees mature enough to produce yields. Also, _promoting species diversity and seeking mutualistic plant synnergies and interdependencies are two Permaculture principles which are key to building for resilience and working effortlessly with nature_. Sunflower plants and peach trees offer good plant companionship to each other, but also planting multiple species of peaches somewhat further apart makes it more difficult for predators to compromise a crop. These techniques also encourages the development of _multiple income streams, increasing the resilience of farms by avoiding over-reliance on a single product_. 

_Closing resource loops is also an essential element in efficiently using resources, and replenishing nutrient cycles_. The biomass of old unproductive trees can be used to produce energy, compost or charcoal. Tree trunks and coffee waste collected from nearby cities are increasingly being used by mushroom growers to produce exotic varieties like shitake, which are currently a good source of income for farmers. On-farm composting sites help not only in reducing organic waste, but also produce natural fertiziler which can be used back as an inp on the land. 

The combination of all these new alternative agricultural business models, based on positive feedback and closing resource loops gives hope for the re-birth of farms as economically thriving options. Building and managing such production systems in a regenerative way is knowledge-intensive on the side of those managing the farm, but it also builds social capital. Combining this type of labor with #community ownership models can also be a source of deeper satisfaction and empowerment for those involved. 

##Consumption 

### Towards a new food culture: between tradition and innovation

_180w_  

Alongside with these more structural interventions in food supply chains, consumption patterns, awareness and education about the importance of these models for maintaining food resilience is crucial. 

One one hand, movements such as SlowFood already offer some solutions for reviving local food cultures. Their programs focus on re-incouraging the consumption of forgotten regional varieties of grains or legumes, re-developing a market for them in restaurant chains, as well as re-establishing connections between consumers and farmers. 

On the other,  it is important to also _stimulate innovation in traditional food cultures away from over-reliance on meat and fish_. Restaurants and food production ventures can play an essential role in shiftingt he perception of consumers from seeing alternative and lower impact sources of protein, such as insects or algae, as 'hip' and 'positive food trends' instead of 'taboo' [4](4). Experimentation with consumer preference, perception as well as involving consumers in practical workshops can further support the transition towards consumption patters with an environmental impact which our ecosystems can sustain. 

And why not - these spaces for food experimentation and business models can be part of the very conscious #communities and #networks we are aggregating!
